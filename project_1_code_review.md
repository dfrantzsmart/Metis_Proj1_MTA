# Project 1 Code Review


## Clean Code 

Clean Code. Follows PEP-8, uses descriptive object names, appropriate comments, general and reproducible objects, functions accomplish a clear task etc

- Very clean code. Functions were clearly defined and implemented throughout your code. 
- Reminder-functions should be lowercase, with words separated by underscores
- Be more descriptive about how you name variables. For example, you called a variable data_frame. 
  Naming the dataframe something more descriptive will make it easier to read and understand your code own code when you revisit later. 
  You did a good job of this,just be consistent throughout the entire notebook
- Excellent job saving dataframes as pickled objects.
- Consider using py files to conduct other preprocessing methods such as drop na, deleting rows where the difference between Total_Traffic_y and Total_Traffic.



## Good Documentation

Markdown explains work and defines sections, visualizations are easy to read and they relate to content, thought process is clear, etc.

- Excellent README. Clearly laid out the purpose,plan,and findings of your project. Set the tone for the repo
- Visuals were very good. Large titles and axis labels. MTA_Visuals folder made it easy to access.
- Creating 


## Proper Data Science

Models are correctly specified (e.g., no heteroskedasticity in interpreting a linear model), valid conclusions drawn from visualizations, etc

Project 1 is focused on data exploration, cleaning, and visualization. Therefore, we are this section will be assessed on those topics.

- Very good idea illustrating traffic as well as your demographic on plots to show the balance between the two
- Great data science thinking to create a weight adjusted model. This type of thought process is what employers are looking for in candidates.
